# 🧠 AI in Action: History, Algorithms & Game Projects

This project is a part of my Artificial Intelligence course, where I explored the fundamentals of AI through theoretical concepts and practical implementation of classical search algorithms. The course culminated in building three interactive Python games: **Tic Tac Toe**, **8 Puzzle Solver**, and **Chess AI**.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course covered:
- History and evolution of AI
- Real-life applications of AI
- Core AI search algorithms
  - **Uninformed Search**: BFS, DFS, Depth-Limited, Iterative Deepening, Bidirectional
  - **Informed Search**: Heuristic Search, Best-First Search, A*, AO*
  - **Local & Adversarial Search**: Hill Climbing, Beam Search, Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Hands-on game development using Python and Pygame

## 🎮 Game Implementations

### ✅ Tic Tac Toe
- Algorithm: Min-Max
- Features: AI vs Player, optimal moves using game tree search

### ✅ 8 Puzzle Solver
- Algorithm: A* Search with Manhattan Distance Heuristic
- Features: GUI using Pygame, animated tile solving

### ✅ Chess AI
- Tools: `python-chess`, Pygame
- Features: Player vs AI using Alpha-Beta pruning with basic evaluation logic

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pygame**
- **python-chess**
- AI libraries, custom logic for search algorithms
