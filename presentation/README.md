## AI Topics Covered

- **Uniformed Search Algorithms:**  
  BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening Search, Bidirectional Search, Depth Limited Search

- **Informed Search Algorithms:**  
  Heuristic Search, Best First Search, A*, AO* Algorithm

- **Local Search Algorithms:**  
  Hill Climbing, Beam Search

- **Adversarial Search Algorithms:**  
  Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning

---

## AI Projects Showcased

- **Tic Tac Toe** (Python): AI powered by Minimax Algorithm  
- **Chess** (Python): AI with Minimax & Alpha-Beta Pruning  
- **8 Puzzle Solver** (Python): A* Search Algorithm based solver

---

## Tools Used

- **Presentation:** Pictory.ai for easy creation of engaging slides with voice-over  
- **Video:** Gamma.ai for quick, AI-powered video generation with smooth animations and text overlays  
- **Programming:** Python and Pygame for AI algorithm implementation in games

## AI Prompt Used for Presentation (Pictory.ai)

> "Create a clean, minimalistic slideshow presentation titled **'AI in Action: From Search Algorithms to Smart Games'**. The slides should cover Uniformed Search (BFS, DFS, IDS, Bidirectional, DLS), Informed Search (A*, Best First, AO*), Local Search (Hill Climbing, Beam Search), Adversarial Search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta), and showcase three AI games: Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and 8-Puzzle. Include simple visuals, icons, and brief explanatory text. The tone should be educational and engaging, suitable for a 10-12 slide presentation."

## AI Prompt Used for Video (Gamma.ai)

> "Create a 1 minute 30 seconds educational video titled **'AI in 90 Seconds: From Search to Smart Games'**. Use clean, modern visuals and animated text to explain core AI algorithms: Uniformed Search (BFS, DFS, IDS, Bidirectional, DLS), Informed Search (A*, Best First, AO*), Local Search (Hill Climbing, Beam Search), and Adversarial Search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta). Show Python-based AI games: Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and 8-Puzzle with quick visual highlights. Keep the video minimalistic, fast-paced, and suitable for social media sharing. No talking characters, subtle background music."
